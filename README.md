Linux custom xbindkeys/xinput mapping for more ergonomic usage of M618 vertical mouse series.

- [ ] Keep scrolling while holding right-sideway buttons

## Maximum confort

If you are using a vertical mouse, chances are that you are trying to avoid Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

By not using a traditional flat horizontal mouse, you already aleviate a lot of tension from your wrist, but that's not enough!

This M618 model comes with a traditional scroll wheel which requires still a lot of movement from your middle finger throughout a normal daily working routine.

In order to reduce as much as possible the movements of your fingers, I present a different button configuration to use alongside this nice mouse.

### Using your stronger thumb finger for left/right click

The buttons normally reserved for backward and forward navigation are now used as left and right click respectively.

### Scrolling with less effort as possible

The buttons originally used as left and right click are now used as scroll up and scroll down respectively.
The idea is simple: you just click and the pages click scrolling as you need.
No more wheel scrolling killing your finger and forearm anymore.

### Wheel to go back and forth

Since we don't want to lose all the original functionalities, now we map the backward and forward functionalities to the scroll wheel since this is not so much common as the other actions,
so the effort doesn't hurt you.
